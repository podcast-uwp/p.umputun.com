Review Hugo site changes for correctness, security, and quality problems.

## Template Correctness

1. Hugo function usage - correct function signatures, proper piping, valid arguments
2. Partial references - all {{ partial }} calls reference existing partial files
3. Variable scope - variables defined and accessible in current context (.Page, .Site, .Params)
4. Range/with blocks - proper use of context (.), correct iteration patterns
5. Conditional logic - correct use of if/else/with/range, no unreachable branches
6. Safe HTML output - proper use of safeHTML, safeCSS, safeJS where needed

## Config and Data Correctness

1. TOML syntax - valid config.toml, no syntax errors
2. Required fields - all Hugo-required config fields present
3. Menu definitions - menu items reference valid pages, correct weights
4. Params consistency - site params used in templates actually defined in config

## Content Integrity

1. Frontmatter - valid YAML/TOML frontmatter in content files, required fields present
2. Shortcodes - all shortcode calls reference defined shortcodes
3. Image references - referenced images exist in static/ or content directories
4. Internal links - links to other pages use valid paths

## Security Analysis

1. No secrets in templates or config - API keys, tokens, credentials
2. Proper escaping - user-generated content properly escaped
3. External resource integrity - CDN links use subresource integrity where appropriate

## Simplicity Assessment

1. Direct solutions first - if simple template logic works, don't use complex partials
2. No unnecessary nesting - avoid deeply nested template blocks
3. Question every partial - each partial should serve a clear purpose
4. No scope creep - changes solve only the stated problem

## What to Report

For each issue:
- Location: exact file path and line number
- Issue: clear description
- Impact: how this affects the site
- Fix: specific suggestion

Focus on defects that would cause build failures, broken rendering, or security issues.
Report problems only - no positive observations.
