Verify Hugo site build integrity and template correctness.

Note: Hugo has no unit test framework. "Testing" means verifying the site builds correctly and all references resolve.

## Build Verification

1. Hugo build - does `hugo` complete without errors or warnings?
2. Template rendering - are there any template execution errors in build output?
3. Missing content - does Hugo report any missing referenced content?

## Reference Integrity

1. Partial references - every {{ partial "name" }} has a corresponding file in layouts/partials/ or theme partials
2. Shortcode references - every shortcode used in content has a definition
3. Layout references - content types have corresponding layout files
4. Image paths - referenced images exist in static/images/ or page bundles
5. Internal links - cross-references between pages use valid paths

## Asset Integrity

1. SCSS/CSS imports - all @import statements reference existing files
2. JavaScript references - script tags point to existing files
3. Font references - font files exist where referenced
4. Icon references - icon files or icon font classes are valid

## Content Consistency

1. Frontmatter fields - required fields present in all content files
2. Date formats - dates follow consistent format (YYYYMMDD in filenames)
3. Taxonomy consistency - categories/tags used consistently
4. Permalink structure - content organization matches permalink config

## What to Report

For each finding:
- Location: file path and line number
- Issue: what reference is broken or what's missing
- Impact: what would break or render incorrectly
- Fix: how to resolve the issue

Report problems only - no positive observations.
