Detect over-engineered and overcomplicated Hugo templates, config, and site structure.

## Excessive Template Complexity

- Deep nesting - templates with 3+ levels of if/with/range blocks
- Unnecessary partials - partial used in only one place that could be inlined
- Over-parameterized partials - partials accepting many parameters when simpler approach works
- Redundant context passing - passing same data through multiple partial layers

## Config Over-Engineering

- Excessive params - config parameters that are never used in templates
- Unused menu entries - menu items defined but not rendered
- Unnecessary taxonomies - taxonomy definitions with no corresponding list templates
- Duplicate config - same value defined in multiple places

## Unnecessary Indirection

- Wrapper partials - partial that just calls another partial
- Redundant data files - data files that could be simple config params
- Excessive shortcodes - shortcodes for simple HTML that could be markdown

## SCSS/CSS Complexity

- Deeply nested selectors - more than 3 levels of SCSS nesting
- Unused variables - SCSS variables defined but never referenced
- Redundant overrides - styles that override and then re-declare the same value
- Unnecessary mixins - mixins used only once

## Future-Proofing Excess

- Unused template blocks - define/block patterns with no overrides
- Conditional logic for impossible states - checks for conditions that never occur
- Multilingual setup when single-language - i18n overhead for Russian-only site

## What to Report

For each finding:
- Location: file and line reference
- Pattern: which over-engineering pattern detected
- Problem: why this adds unnecessary complexity
- Simplification: what simpler approach would look like
- Effort: trivial/small/medium/large

Report problems only - no positive observations.
