Review code changes and identify missing documentation updates.

## README.md (Human Documentation)

Check if changes require README updates:

Must document:
- New features or site capabilities
- New content types or taxonomies
- Changed theme behavior or appearance
- New configuration options
- New build requirements or commands
- Breaking changes to site structure

Skip:
- Content additions (new blog posts)
- Minor style tweaks
- Internal template refactoring with no user-visible changes

## CLAUDE.md (AI Knowledge Base)

Check if changes require CLAUDE.md updates:

Must document:
- New Hugo conventions or patterns established
- Theme customization patterns
- New build/deploy commands or workflows
- Project structure changes
- Hugo version compatibility notes
- New shortcodes or partials with non-obvious behavior

Skip:
- Simple content additions
- Minor template fixes
- Style adjustments using existing patterns

## Plan Files

If changes relate to an existing plan:
- Mark completed items as done
- Update plan status if needed
- Note which plan items this change addresses

## What to Report

For each gap:
- Missing: what needs to be documented
- Section: where in the documentation it should go
- Suggested content: draft text or outline

Report problems only - no positive observations.
