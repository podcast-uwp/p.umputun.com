Review whether the implementation achieves the stated goal/requirement.

## Core Review Responsibilities

1. Requirement coverage - does implementation address all aspects of the stated requirement? Are there edge cases or scenarios not handled?

2. Correctness of approach - is the chosen approach actually solving the right problem? Could it fail in certain conditions (different browsers, screen sizes, content lengths)?

3. Template wiring - are all templates, partials, and layouts connected properly? Are new partials included where needed? Are config values referenced correctly?

4. Completeness - are there missing pieces that would prevent the feature from working? Missing partials, undefined shortcodes, unset config params, missing SCSS imports?

5. Content rendering - does content render correctly? Are Hugo template functions producing expected output? Do markdown files with the changes display properly?

6. Edge cases - empty content, very long titles, missing images, pages without certain frontmatter fields?

## What to Report

For each issue found:
- Issue: clear description of what's wrong
- Impact: how this prevents achieving the goal
- Location: file and line reference
- Fix: what needs to be added or changed

Focus on correctness of approach, not code style.
Report problems only - no positive observations.
