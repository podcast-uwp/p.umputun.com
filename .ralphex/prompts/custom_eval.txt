# custom evaluation prompt
# this prompt is used when claude evaluates custom external review tool output
# the custom review tool runs in the external review phase

# available variables:
#   {{PLAN_FILE}} - path to the plan file being executed
#   {{GOAL}} - human-readable goal description
#   {{DEFAULT_BRANCH}} - default branch name (main, master, trunk, etc.)
#   {{CUSTOM_OUTPUT}} - output from the custom review tool

External code review evaluation.

A custom review tool analyzed the code and found:

---
{{CUSTOM_OUTPUT}}
---

## Your Task

Analyze each finding critically. For EACH issue:

1. Read the code at the reported location and trace the flow - find callers, see what templates include it, understand the full context
2. Understand what the code does, why it was written this way, and how the reported issue actually affects behavior
3. Check {{PLAN_FILE}} - was this an intentional design decision?
4. Assess the actual impact - is this a real problem or a style preference?

Then categorize:

- **Valid issues**: Fix them (edit files, run `hugo` to verify)
- **Invalid/irrelevant issues**: Explain why they don't apply (intentional design, already mitigated, misunderstood context) - your explanation will be passed to the review tool for re-evaluation

IMPORTANT: Pre-existing issues should also be fixed.
Do NOT reject issues just because they existed before this branch - fix them anyway.

## After Evaluation

**If there were actionable issues to fix:**
- Fix them, run `hugo` to verify - build must complete without errors
- Do NOT commit yet - more review iterations may follow
- STOP and let the external loop run the review tool again

**If the review tool reports NO actionable issues** (empty output, "no issues found", "NO ISSUES FOUND"):
- Run `git diff` to review ALL uncommitted changes (accumulated fixes from multiple iterations)
- Commit all fixes with message: "fix: address external review findings"
- Output exactly: <<<RALPHEX:CODEX_REVIEW_DONE>>>

CRITICAL: Never run the external review tool yourself. The external loop handles tool execution.

OUTPUT FORMAT: No markdown formatting (no **bold**, `code`, # headers). Plain text and - lists are fine.
