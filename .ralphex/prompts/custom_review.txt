## Get the Diff

Run this command to see the changes:
{{DIFF_INSTRUCTION}}

## Review Focus

Analyze the code for:

1. Template errors - broken partial references, undefined variables, incorrect Hugo function usage
2. Config issues - invalid TOML syntax, missing required fields, deprecated settings
3. Content problems - broken frontmatter, invalid dates, missing required fields
4. Asset issues - broken image paths, missing SCSS imports, invalid CSS
5. Security - secret exposure in templates or config, improper escaping of user content
6. Broken references - links to non-existent pages, missing partials, undefined shortcodes

## Output Format

Report issues as a structured list:

- file:line - description of issue
- file:line - description of issue

If no issues found, output: NO ISSUES FOUND

## Important

- Focus on real problems, not style preferences
- Check if issues are already mitigated in the code
- Only report issues you can verify by reading the actual code
- Be specific about file paths and line numbers
