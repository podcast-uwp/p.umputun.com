In response to my [tweet](https://twitter.com/umputun/status/74988684117688320), a noticeable amount of most curious comments came. By the way, here it is, the original tweet:

> funny article [habrahabr.ru](http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/android/120072/) - turn off 3g, wifi, backlight and BT and then your android will be almost like iPhone in battery life :)

I'll stipulate that I know little about Androids personally, and I won't presume to judge how accurate this is or isn't. But the very pathos of the note seemed quite revealing and educational to me for those for whom the question of their smartphone's battery life is not a question at all, and the phone works without recharging enough and more than enough. I have 2 such phones: iPhone 4 and BB Bold.

However, the conversation is about something completely different. In response, protests, cries, and sarcastic questions started coming to me through various channels. I don't know why all this was sent to me and not to the article's author. "Not my circus, not my monkeys..." One commenter suggested that I simply don't understand the Russian language of the article, and that it's actually about something completely different. For greater clarity for such a "non-Russian Chukchi", he wrote his assumption in sort-of-English. But that's in the oddities section. But in the section of dense arguments I got a lot of strange stuff:

- if you force your iPhone to sync everything in real time then it will be even worse. Our Androids do everything automatically and you have to press a button to update (the person didn't know about push)
- and you on iPhone turn on synchronization of five email accounts and open 10 applications in the background. will die faster (than) Android (apparently not aware of how "multitasking" is arranged on iPhone)
- when iPhone finally gets 3G then we'll compare (3g has been on iPhone for a very long time)
- Well of course, but our screen is visible outdoors, and on iPhone - try to make out what's there (don't know what screen the author was talking about, but clearly only saw iPhone in reviews)
- It's all about GPS. In Android it's more accurate and naturally consumes more (no words)
- This show-off phone doesn't even have Bluetooth! (and where did Bluetooth go?)
- For freedom from slavery I'm ready to put up with the fact that my phone needs charging twice a day
- You're lying! All modern smartphones require at least daily charging! This is the price for computing power and large screen. (this was in response to my remark that I charge every other day and if I forget then even every two days)
- When iPhone is as rich in interface elements, then you'll understand that you have to pay for everything (I don't even imagine what the author is talking about)
- This is just ridiculous! A phone that costs $600 dollars and for which suckers pay $100-$150 a month for the rest of their lives, comparing with an affordable Android (what? where?)
- In general, this iPhone of yours is for show-off! (substantial, yes)

What's all this about? It's about the fact that the authors of the overwhelming number of "exposés" are absolutely not aware of what they're criticizing. Well, they're just not in the loop at all. This is normal, but only until they start "argumentatively" proving that black is white and a whale is stronger than an elephant.
