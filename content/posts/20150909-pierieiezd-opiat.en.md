This blog has already developed a dubious tradition of moving to a new platform once every few years. As a rule, these moves are caused by something reasonable. I remember there was a move from wordpress, a move from blogger, then from something else whose name I've already forgotten.

The last variant (static, markdown, octopress) lasted longest, though it too began showing all the signs that the time had come:

1. Since 2011 this product has practically not been developed. The last promise on the author's site was in January, saying soon, very soon. But nothing has happened.
2. Living with this "old" octopress in its environment (ruby) became hard. Though Docker helped survive, it's of course a crutch.
3. Writing to the blog is not as convenient as I'd like. Of course, the idea of writing in markdown is good, but would like convenient image addition and preview.

And here's the new move to ghost+buster. So far this seems like quite a decent option to me — static is preserved, markdown is preserved and a nice visual editor with preview right in the browser is added.

All this I, of course, wrapped in a container and started transferring old posts. So far got to 2011, but over time will cover the whole history.

**In comments to this post you can and should report found issues. I tried to transfer everything carefully, but could have missed something.**

_If anyone is interested in instructions for raising something similar "for almost regular people", let me know. Everything here is not complicated, but there are subtle moments._
