Today I decided to try to improve the world a bit in the simplest way — by giving advice. After all, the 21st century is here, ships plow... and here's a problem with delivering killed trees. In my opinion, my proposals are quite reasonable and the idea is very sound, agree?

If there's anyone close to the journal's body, let them know about your support for this idea, maybe they'll listen and get it.

>Dear Editor,
>
>From my practical experience of receiving your wonderful magazine outside Russia, or rather from the experience of months-long waiting, it seems to me that you have very serious problems with paper edition delivery. I fully understand that maybe the post office is to blame or some other logistics, but from the recipient's point of view this understanding helps me little.
>
>Hence the question/proposal — are you planning to sell a subscription to the electronic version? I would gladly subscribe even one more time, but so as not to wait 2-3 months for each issue. This shouldn't be something complex, repeating the magazine's layout, but a simple text version with minimal formatting would be quite sufficient. I want to draw your attention to the fact that very serious publications failed in electronic form largely because of attempts to "make it beautiful, like on paper", and the completely plain The Magazine which has only text and minimal illustrations, and which is very simple (according to the author) to prepare, quite prospers and delights readers with quality content.
>
>I would assume that in your case such an electronic version would be successful and wouldn't require a separate, complex layout and other headaches from you. And for me, as a reader, consuming promptly delivered content in simple electronic format would be extremely pleasant.
>
> respectfully,
>
>Umputun
