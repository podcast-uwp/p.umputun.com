About five years have passed since the [last migration](http://p.umputun.com/2015/09/09/pierieiezd-opiat/) of this blog. During this time I was able to confirm that the transition to my quirky configuration didn't help the cause of writing posts at all, but even had the opposite effect.

Today I had the desire and opportunity to write something that's not easy to tell with words, but it turned out I completely forgot how to do it :( Of course, in the process of figuring things out everything came back, but it turned out that this setup is outdated, insecure and requires updating.

Since updating from such an old version is practically impossible, I decided to simplify and standardize everything I could, even if it goes against the idea of convenience. As a result, I installed a completely standard [hugo](https://gohugo.io), which we've been using for several years both for [Radio-T](https://radio-t.com) and for [my podcast](http://podcast.umputun.com).

The entire site now lives [on github](https://github.com/podcast-uwp/p.umputun.com) and this, I hope, will help with quickly fixing found bugs and other problems.

_And yes, I was wrong 5 years ago when, in response to suggestions to "just use hugo," I wanted something strange_
